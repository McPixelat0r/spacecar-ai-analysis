# Project Summary Log: Space Car Simulator and AI System (2025)

---

## 🌐 Project Description
A physics-based simulation of futuristic space cars navigating asteroid fields and dangerous space environments. The system models realistic physics (rotational inertia, thrust, fuel usage, crash detection), perception (imperfect sensors), and eventual machine learning models to optimize space travel and crash avoidance.

Final project goal: **A lightweight 2D simulation + AI-ready pipeline**.

Target: **Presentation-ready by Tuesday**, with follow-up deeper learning and extension.

## 📅 Major Milestones Reached

| Date | Accomplishment |
|:-----|:----------------|
| Apr 2025 | Clean and polished project folder structure finalized (models_clean_polished/, generation_clean_polished/, etc.) |
| Apr 2025 | RawFeatureGenerator created and validated (realistic car specs and perception fields) |
| Apr 2025 | Added realistic sensor noise injection (add_sensor_noise) to perception fields |
| Apr 2025 | SimulatedTripEvaluator created and validated (DangerScore, TripScore, NoEscapeZone detection) |
| Apr 2025 | Crash detection based on proximity and DangerScore implemented |
| Apr 2025 | Crash severity grading (Deadly, Total Loss, Major, Medium, Minor Damage) integrated into trip evaluation |
| Apr 2025 | Full 1000-row simulation batch generated and completed cleanly (no errors) |

## 📆 Design Pivots and Key Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|:---------|:-------|
| Realized synthetic CSVs are pre-training precursors, not final training data | Avoid premature over-analysis; 2D simulator needed first |
| Decided to cleanly finish perception realism phase before starting 2D simulator | Avoid building a weak, unrealistic 2D environment |
| Accepted Hugging Face as future model hosting platform | Ensure reproducibility, portability, presentation-readiness |
| Committed to milestone-based development over chaotic feature creep | Maintain forward momentum and avoid burnout |

## 📈 Completed Core Systems

- **FuelUsageModelEnhanced**: Fuel consumption model based on weight, thrust, danger, moment of inertia.
- **SimulatedTripEvaluator**: Trip quality assessment with crash and no-escape detection.
- **RawFeatureGenerator**: Procedural generation of synthetic but realistic raw trip and car data.
- **Sensor Noise Injection**: Random, bounded perturbations added to perception fields.
- **Crash Severity Model**: Graded crash detection (Deadly -> Minor) based on DangerScore and MinDistance.

## ⌛ Backlogged / Optional Features (Not Yet Started)

- Clumped threat generation (dense and sparse asteroid fields)
- Simulate sensor glitches (rare extreme perception errors)
- Start basic 2D movement modeling (velocity, position, heading updates)
- Dynamic threat movement (moving asteroids)
- Emergency decision system (prioritize passenger survival)
- Train AI crash prediction or navigation optimizers
- Deploy trained models to Hugging Face for reproducibility
- Create clean loading utilities (from_pretrained())
- Formal project documentation / Obsidian knowledge vault creation
