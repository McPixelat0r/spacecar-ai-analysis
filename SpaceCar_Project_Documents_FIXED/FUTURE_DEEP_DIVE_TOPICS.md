# Future Deep Dive Topics for Post-Presentation Study

---

## ðŸ“‚ Model Saving, Formats, and Deployment Topics

- Overview of model saving formats:
  - `.pt` (PyTorch models)
  - `.h5` (TensorFlow/Keras models)
  - `.onnx` (Open standard for interoperability)
- How to save and load trained models properly
- Model metadata: what it is, why it matters (documenting input/output structure, features)
- Hugging Face model hosting overview:
  - Uploading models to Hugging Face Hub
  - Creating a model card (basic README.md for the model)
  - Versioning models
- Loading models into notebooks and applications:
  - Using `.from_pretrained()` or custom loading scripts
- Deployment-ready formats vs. training-only formats
- Lightweight models for laptop presentations vs. full training versions
- License and sharing considerations (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

âœ… These topics are flagged for in-depth review once core simulation and initial presentation are complete.

âœ… Organized, professional deployment ensures reproducibility, portability, and future growth.
